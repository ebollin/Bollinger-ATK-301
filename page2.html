There are a couple of steps to promote an app.
<li>Find a niche market and focus your design choices to that <span class="text">audience.</span>
<li>Find a design <span class="text">mentor</span> who will support your exploration and give critical feedback.
<li>Test the app <span class="text">experience</span> with participants to ensure that the experience you expect is the experience had by audiences.
<li>Target your audience to ask for specific <span class="text">needs </span>they have.
<li>When your app is complete and tested properly, deploy it in <span class="text">accessible </span>marketplaces.
</ul>

<h2><span class="subheader">FAQ</span></h2>
<h4>When should I ask my target audience for their preferred features?</h4>
<p> Ask multiple times in the process, starting with the beginning of the project. Your audience might have different needs or restrictions that you have not thought of.</p>
<h4>Can I create a few wireframes and have someone turn it into an app for me?</h4>
No. You will need to conceive of the usable design, the backend coding and account for the whole user <em>experience</em> yourself or as a team.
<h4>Can I spend a couple of minutes with a customer and have it count as design critique?</h4>
<p>No, you need to fully understand the user's context for using the app to ensure it is most effective. Plan to spend at least an hour with them using the app.</P>
<h2>What do I do when I have released a beta version of my app?</h2>
<p>Be ready to address system bugs as they occur from your users.</p>
