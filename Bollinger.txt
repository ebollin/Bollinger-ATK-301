I\'92m a sophomore Arts Tech Major and Music Minor, I transferred here from the University of South Carolina halfway through my freshman year. I was on the drum line at USC and was a photographer for the University\'92s newspaper. I love photography, music, art, and animals. If I wasn\'92t an Arts Tech Major I\'92d be studying environmental science and try to help animals and the planet. }
